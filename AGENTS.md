# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Source lives in `src/` with focused modules:
  - `core/` (Psychoacoustic DSP primitives):
    - `log2space.rs`: Log-frequency coordinate system (octave-based).
    - `nsgt*.rs`: Non-Stationary Gabor Transform implementations (RT, FFT, and Kernel variants).
    - `harmonicity_kernel.rs`: Virtual pitch/root detection via harmonic templates.
    - `roughness_kernel.rs`: Sensory dissonance calculation via interference kernels.
    - `phase.rs`: Phase wrap/diff utilities (shared across rhythm + kernels).
    - `landscape.rs`: Real-time integration of Roughness and Harmonicity.
    - `fft.rs`: FFT wrappers and Hilbert transform logic.
    - `erb.rs`: Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth scales.
  - `audio/` (Real-time I/O):
    - `output.rs`: cpal stream management (ringbuffer producer).
    - `buffer.rs`: Interleaved audio buffer types.
    - `writer.rs`: Disk recording (WAV).
  - `synth/` (Synthesis engine):
    - Phase-vocoder/additive synthesis based on NSGT bins.
  - `ui/` (UI and visualization):
    - Egui views, plots, and visualization logic.
  - `life/` (Agents and behaviors):
    - Individual/Population models, temporal cores, fields, and scenario scripting.
  - `web/` (Project website):
    - Zola site sources.
- Entrypoints: `src/main.rs` (binary) and `src/app.rs` (GUI/Thread wiring).
- Samples: execution-test scripts live under `tests/scripts/`. Compile-only samples stay under `samples/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Build (debug): `cargo build`
- Run (release): `cargo run --release` (Recommended for real-time DSP performance)
- Tests: `cargo test`.  Run tests always after modifying code.
- Format: `cargo fmt --all`
- Lint: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- **Comments**:  All comments must be in concise English.  Do not use Japanese in code comments.
- **DSP Efficiency**: Prefer `f32`. Avoid allocations in the audio thread (`worker_loop`). Use `Vec::with_capacity` or pre-allocated ringbuffers.
- **Naming**: `snake_case` for modules/functions, `CamelCase` for structs/traits.

## Architecture Notes for Agents
- The core perception model is **Landscape**. It ingests audio, transforms it to Log2-frequency space via NSGT, and computes two potentials:
  1. **Roughness (R)**: Amplitude fluctuations within critical bands (dissonance).
  2. **Harmonicity (H)**: Periodicity/Template matching (consonance/fusion).



## Terminology: predictive/perceptual vs potential/state (R/H)

We use two orthogonal axes. Do not mix them.

### Axis A: WorldModel layer (origin)
- **predictive** (`pred_*`): hypothesis derived from IntentBoard / internal model (zero-latency).
- **perceptual** (`perc_*`): evidence derived from actual audio analysis (NSGT/filterbank; delayed).
- **error** (`err_*`): `err_* = perc_* - pred_*`.

`perceptual` is reserved for this axis only.

### Axis B: representation (kernel output vs normalized state)
- **potential** (`*_pot_*`): raw kernel output / physical-ish quantity (unnormalized; references not applied yet).
- **state** (`*_state_*`): normalized / referenced / composed quantities used for decision making or logging
  (e.g. 0..1, and `C = clamp(H01 - wR*R01, -1..1)`).

Potential/state is orthogonal to pred/perc:
- `pred_h_pot_scan`, `pred_h_state01_scan`
- `perc_r_pot_scan`, `perc_c_state_scan`
- `err_c_state_scan = perc_c_state_scan - pred_c_state_scan`

### Suffix convention (avoid ambiguity)
Use explicit suffixes when needed:
- `_scan`: frequency-indexed arrays (Log2Space bins)
- `_scalar`: summary values (total/max/p95 etc.)

Example:
- `perc_r_state01_scalar`
- `pred_c_state_scan`


## Scenario Script Authoring
**Keep simple things simple, and complex things possible.**

Scenarios should be approachable for newcomers while remaining expressive for advanced use cases:

- A minimal scenario should require only essential parameters
- Complex behaviors emerge from composition, not configuration bloat
- The full parameter space remains accessible for those who need it


## Other
- Don't touch `web/` when editing sourcecode. Don't touch `src/` when editing `web/`, unless otherwise specified.
- `docs/generated`, `docs/schemas`, `docs/rhai-book` are auto-generated by scripts. Don't touch them directly.
