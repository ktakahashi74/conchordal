# Welcome to Conchordal

Conchordal is a bio-acoustic instrument for generative composition that transforms biological sound patterns into musical compositions. By analyzing natural acoustic phenomena, it creates unique generative music that bridges the gap between nature and technology.

## About the Project

This project explores the intersection of biological acoustics and algorithmic composition. Using advanced signal processing techniques, Conchordal captures and interprets the complex acoustic patterns found in nature, transforming them into dynamic musical compositions.

## Key Features

- **Bio-acoustic Analysis**: Real-time processing of biological sound patterns
- **Generative Composition**: AI-driven music generation based on natural acoustic data
- **Real-time Performance**: Low-latency processing suitable for live performance
- **Open Source**: Fully open-source project built with Rust

## Getting Started
