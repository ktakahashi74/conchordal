## Composing with Conchordal

Composition in Conchordal is **scenario scripting**. You write **Rhai** scripts that define when and how sound agents spawn into the cognitive landscape. Instead of placing notes directly, you configure agent parameters and let them find consonance through emergent interaction on the landscape.
