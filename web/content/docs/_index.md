## Composing with Conchordal

Composition in Conchordal is **scenario scripting**—the act of designing temporal structures in which autonomous sound agents explore the cognitive landscape and discover their own harmonies. Unlike conventional composition where sounds are placed onto symbolic grids (staff notation, piano rolls), Conchordal's scripting defines *when* and *how* agents are spawned into the landscape, allowing them to find consonance through interaction and emergence rather than explicit note-by-note control.

Scenarios are written in **Rhai**, a lightweight scripting language. Through Rhai, you choreograph the temporal unfolding of sound: creating species of agents, spawning groups at specific times, setting their initial parameters, and modulating the landscape's physics. The script becomes a score not of fixed notes but of generative processes—a blueprint for musical emergence.
